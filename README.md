# CircularConstructionTools
Four open source, Excel-based tools to assess circularity in building projects, developed as part of the Circular Construction for Urban Development Manual.
 1) The Circularity Tool calculates a circularity score for a whole building and individual building parts, highlighting the benefits of reuse, longevity and design for disassembly. It is an adaptation (among others) of the Material Circularity Indicator proposed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation, at the scale of a whole building.
 2) The Existing Reuse Tool provides a rough estimate of the embodied carbon savings that can be achieved by reusing elements from an existing building in a new project. It is meant for scoping and prioritizing in very early design stages.
 3) The Planetary Boundary Tool is used to set an absolute target for a project's climate impact, by scaling down the Planetary Boundary for climate change. This involves several normative choices, which are explained further in the Doughnut Economics for Urban Development manual - see https://www.home.earth/doughnut
 4) The Upfront Carbon Tool provides a simple way of visualizing greenhouse gas emissions from a project happening today. It provides alternative ways of visualizing results from an existing LCA study.
